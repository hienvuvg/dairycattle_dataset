Annotation Rules for Visual Data
------
**Isometric-view cow identification:** \\

**Cow behaviors:** \\

| # | Behavior | Definition | Visual example |
|-------------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| 0 | Unknow | When the cow is absent or the light is off | N/A |
| 1 | Walking | Moving from one location to another between consecutive frames |  |
| 2 | Standing | The legs are straight up for supporting the body and the head is not at the feeding area | |
| 3 | Feeding head up | The head is at the feeding area and the mouth is above the food | |
| 4 | Feeding head down | The head is at the feeding area and the mouth touches the food | |
| 5 | Licking | Licking the mineral block | |
| 6 | Drinking | Drinking at the water trough, when the mouth touches the water | |
| 7 | Lying | The cow lies in the stall |<img src="docs/imgs/bunching.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;" />|
| 8 | Bunching | When there are at least three cows standing right next to each other including the current cow, excluding standing in the stall, feeding, licking, and drinking |<!--![](docs/imgs/bunching.png)--> |
