Benchmarks
------
Setup:
1. Download and upzip ```sensor_data.zip```, ```visual_data.zip```, and ```pred_labels.zip``` to separate folders
1. Clone this repo to your local directory. In ```./configs/path.yaml```, modify ```sensor_data_dir```, ```visual_data_dir```, and ```pred_label_dir``` to your local directories of the respective folders
2. Install all dependencies using python 3.8 or 3.11 before running the test:<br>```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

There are two options for benchmarking the dataset:\
A. Test all models using provided weights:
1. Navigate to your local directory of this repo 
2. To evaluate the performance of the modalities, run ```test_all_moda.sh```
1. To show the correlations between cows' behavior changes and THI thoughout the deployment, run ```test_behaviors.sh```

B. Train and test all models from scratch:
1. Navigate to your local directory of this repo 
2. To evaluate the performance of the modalities, run ```train_test_all_moda.sh```
1. To show the correlations between cows' behavior changes and THI thoughout the deployment, run ```train_test_behaviors.sh```

Note: Option A is available while the option B is currently in-progress
