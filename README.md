Benchmarks
------
**Benchmarking of UWB-related models:** <br /> 
Setup:
1. Download and upzip ```sensor_data.zip``` and ```visual_data.zip``` to separate folders
1. Clone this repo to your local directory. In ```./configs/path.yaml```, modify ```sensor_data_dir``` and ```visual_data_dir``` to your local directories of the respective folders
2. Install all dependencies using python 3.8 or 3.11, idealy 3.9 before running the test:<br>```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

There are two options for benchmarking the dataset:\
A. Test all models using provided weights:
1. Navigate to your local directory of this repo 
2. To evaluate the performance of the modalities, run ```test_all_moda.sh```
1. To show the correlations between cows' behavior changes and THI thoughout the deployment, run ```test_behaviors.sh```

B. Train and test all models from scratch:
1. Navigate to your local directory of this repo 
2. To evaluate the performance of the modalities, run ```train_test_all_moda.sh```
1. To show the correlations between cows' behavior changes and THI thoughout the deployment, run ```train_test_behaviors.sh```

Note:
* In the scripts, s1 = OS (object-wise split), s2 = TS (temporal split)


**RGBs and RGBm benchmarking:** <br /> 
* Follow [this readme](https://github.com/hienvuvg/dairycattle_dataset/blob/main/benchmarks/1_behavior_cls/rgb/README.md) for benchmarking RGBs and RGBm.

| ```ankle_accel``` | Ankle acceleration from ankle sensors |Every 1 m  | 14 days   |
|```head_direction```| Head direction calculated using tilt-compensated eCompass | 10 Hz|14 days| 
|```ankle_lying``` | Cow's lying behavior calculated from the ankle acceleration using K-mean clustering | Every 1 m | 14 days | 
|```visual_location``` | Cow's 3D body location computed from the annotated data using optimization-based localization | Every 15 s | 1 day | 
|```individual```| Manually annotated individual behaviors of the cows  | 1 Hz| 1 day | 
|```cbt```   | Core body temperature measured by the varginal temperature sensor | Every 1 m    | 14 days |
|```milk_production```    | Daily milk yield of each cow in kg | Daily  | 14 days | 
|```health_info``` | Health information of the cows | Periodically | 14 days | 
|```indoor_condition```  | Temperature and humidity around the pen | Every 1 m | 14 days | 
|```outdoor_weather```  |  Outdoor weather collected by a near by weather station | Every 3 m    | 14 days | 

Vision-related and manually annotated data is available for all 16 cows while data from wearable sensors is available for cow #1 to #10.


Time index format is unix timestamp. When converting unix timestamp to datetime, it needs to be converted to Central Daylight Time (CDT) which is 5 hours off from the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
