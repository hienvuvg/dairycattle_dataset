## MmCows: A Multimodal Dataset for Dairy Cattle Monitoring

### [Click Here for An Overview of MmCows](https://hienvuvg.github.io/mmcows/)

### Data Description:

<!--What this is\-->
This dataset includes two parts: data from wearable sensors and visual data from four cameras.
The wearable sensor data is provide in sensor_data.zip.
The visual data includes multiple sets. The UWB-synced multi-view images for each day of the deployment are available in uwb_synced_images.
The complete internet-time synchronized visual data is provided in video-format in 1s_interval_videos.
In addition, high-resolution photos of individual cows are provided in cow_gallery.zip.

We also provide additional sets of data for benchmarking the dataset such as cropped_bboxes.zip and trained_model_weights.zip.

Benchmarks
------
**Benchmarking of UWB-related models:** <br /> 
Setup:
1. Download and upzip sensor_data.zip and visual_data.zip to separate folders
2. Clone this directory: 
	```
	git clone https://github.com/hienvuvg/dairycattle_dataset
	```
	In ```./configs/path.yaml```, modify ```sensor_data_dir``` and ```visual_data_dir``` to your local directories of the respective folders
3. [Optional] Create a virtual environment using [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/): 
	```
	conda create -n mmcows python=3.9
	conda activate mmcows
	```
4. Install all dependencies using python (3.8 or 3.11, idealy 3.9) before running the test:
	```
	cd dairycattle_dataset
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
<br />
There are two options for benchmarking the dataset:

A. Test all models using the provided weights:
1. Navigate to your local directory of this repo
2. To evaluate the performance of the modalities
	```
	sh test_all_moda.sh
	```
1. To show the correlations between cows' behavior changes and THI thoughout the deployment
	```
	sh test_behaviors.sh
	```

B. Train and test all models from scratch:
1. Navigate to your local directory of this repo
2. To evaluate the performance of the modalities
	```
	sh train_test_all_moda.sh
	```
1. To show the correlations between cows' behavior changes and THI thoughout the deployment
	```
	sh train_test_behaviors.sh
	```

Note:
* In the scripts, s1 = OS (object-wise split), s2 = TS (temporal split)


**RGBs and RGBm benchmarking:** <br /> 
* Follow [this readme](https://github.com/hienvuvg/dairycattle_dataset/blob/main/benchmarks/1_behavior_cls/rgb) for benchmarking RGBs and RGBm.

Vision-related and manually annotated data is available for all 16 cows, while data from wearable sensors is available for cow #1 to #10.


Time index format is unix timestamp. When converting unix timestamp to datetime, it needs to be converted to Central Daylight Time (CDT) which is 5 hours off from the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

For UWB localization, the locations of eight stationary UWB anchors (in meters) are as follows:
1. [-6.10, 5.13, 3.88]
1. [0.00, 5.13, 4.04]
1. [6.10, 5.13, 3.95]
1. [-0.36, 0.00, 5.17]
1. [0.36, 0.00, 5.17]
1. [-6.10, -6.26, 5.47]
1. [0.00, -6.26, 5.36]

Please check [this readme](https://github.com/hienvuvg/dairycattle_dataset/tree/main/visualization) for more details about the visualization tools for MmCows, UWB localization, and visual localization.

Annotation Rules
------

Details of annotation rules for cow ID and behavior are provided in [this online document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NAfwlkVOnybEZPSC2KwAE4i7GHH12huKUijDDizSxiI/edit?usp=sharing). We used [VGG Image Annotator (VIA)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/) to annotate the cow ID. The VIA json files for lying, non-lying, and combined ID lables are available upon request.

The annotation of cow ID is visualized using multi camera views in [this video](https://purdue0-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/vu64_purdue_edu/EUu1qcJUgjNGi8WiQyzjyrABFhwl_RS2b22NjkFYgdZi_w?e=m1H9Qt) (4k, 3.6 GB).
