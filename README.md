Benchmarks
------
**Benchmarking of UWB-related models:** <br /> 
Setup:
1. Download and upzip sensor_data.zip and visual_data.zip to separate folders
2. Clone this directory: 
	```
	git clone https://github.com/hienvuvg/dairycattle_dataset
	```
	In ```./configs/path.yaml```, modify ```sensor_data_dir``` and ```visual_data_dir``` to your local directories of the respective folders
3. [Optional] Create a virtual environment using [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/): 
	```
	conda create -n mmcows python=3.9
	conda activate mmcows
	```
4. Install all dependencies using python (3.8 or 3.11, idealy 3.9) before running the test:
	```
	cd dairycattle_dataset
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
<br />
There are two options for benchmarking the dataset:

A. Test all models using the provided weights:
1. Navigate to your local directory of this repo
2. To evaluate the performance of the modalities
	```
	sh test_all_moda.sh
	```
1. To show the correlations between cows' behavior changes and THI thoughout the deployment
	```
	sh test_behaviors.sh
	```

B. Train and test all models from scratch:
1. Navigate to your local directory of this repo
2. To evaluate the performance of the modalities
	```
	sh train_test_all_moda.sh
	```
1. To show the correlations between cows' behavior changes and THI thoughout the deployment
	```
	sh train_test_behaviors.sh
	```

Note:
* In the scripts, s1 = OS (object-wise split), s2 = TS (temporal split)


**RGBs and RGBm benchmarking:** <br /> 
* Follow [this readme](https://github.com/hienvuvg/dairycattle_dataset/blob/main/benchmarks/1_behavior_cls/rgb) for benchmarking RGBs and RGBm.

Vision-related and manually annotated data is available for all 16 cows, while data from wearable sensors is available for cow #1 to #10.


Time index format is unix timestamp. When converting unix timestamp to datetime, it needs to be converted to Central Daylight Time (CDT) which is 5 hours off from the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

Annotation Rules for Visual Data
------


**Cow behaviors for behavior labels:** 

| # | Behavior | Definition |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| 0 | Unknow | When the cow is absent or the light is off | - |
| 1 | Walking | Moving from one location to another between consecutive frames |  |
| 2 | Standing | The legs are straight up for supporting the body and the head is not at the feeding area | |
| 3 | Feeding head up | The head is at the feeding area and the mouth is above the food | |
| 4 | Feeding head down | The head is at the feeding area and the mouth touches the food | |
| 5 | Licking | Licking the mineral block | |
| 6 | Drinking | Drinking at the water trough, when the mouth touches the water | |
| 7 | Lying | The cow lies in the stall |<!--<img src="docs/imgs/bunching.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;" />-->|

<!--| 8 | Bunching | When there are at least three cows standing right next to each other including the current cow, excluding standing in the stall, feeding, licking, and drinking |<!--![](docs/imgs/bunching.png)--> |-->

Visual examples of the behaviors are provided in ```x.docx``` which is included in the zip.
